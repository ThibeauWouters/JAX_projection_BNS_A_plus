- `injection_8`: has to be rerun
- `injection_10`: t_c is off
- `injection_11`: High SNR, local acceptances dropped, so we have to rerun with a finer step size for the local sampler.
- `injection_27`: Might have needed a bit longer runtime to fully converge. But let's still consider it OK.
- `injection_30`: The posterior looks a bit funny to me.
